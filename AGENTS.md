# AGENT Guidelines for Vacalyser

This document outlines how Codex agents should operate in this repository.

## Code requirements
- **Python** `>=3.10` with type hints.
- Follow **PEP 8** and ensure clean runs of `ruff`, `black` and `mypy`.
- Use Google‑style docstrings for all classes and functions.
- External dependencies are declared in `requirements.txt` and installed via `pip`.

## Project structure
- Entry point: `app.py`.
- Important folders:
  - `pages/` – Streamlit pages.
  - `components/` – UI components.
  - `logic/` – business logic.
  - `services/` – API wrappers and agents.
  - `models/` – Pydantic schemas.
  - `state/` – session handling.
  - `utils/` – prompts and global config.
  - `tests/` – pytest suite.

## Testing and static checks
Run the following before committing:
```bash
ruff .
black --check .
mypy .
pytest
```
All commands must succeed.

## Commit conventions
- Use feature branches (`feat/...`), open PRs against `dev`.
- Commit messages follow **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:` …) with a short summary (max 60 characters).
- Update `README` or `CHANGELOG` in PRs where relevant.
- Provide migration scripts when models change.

## LLM‑specific guidelines
- Use `services/vector_search.VectorStore.search()` to fetch relevant snippets instead of entire documents.
- Validate agent outputs against `models.VacancyProfile` and log parsing errors. If validation fails, trigger a refinement prompt.
- Write unit tests with dummy returns before enabling real API calls.
- Read secrets from environment variables (`os.getenv`), never hard‑code them.
- New prompts should integrate with existing templates in `utils/prompts.py` and support multiple languages without overwriting current templates.

## Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
