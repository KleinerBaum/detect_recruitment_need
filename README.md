# Recruitment Need Analysis Tool

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the Streamlit interface:

```bash
streamlit run "Recruitment_Need_Analysis_Tool.py"
```

3. Launch the simple chat demo:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The interface now includes responsive CSS that stacks columns on
smartphone screens for easier use on the go. After you answer all
questions the assistant shows a short summary of the collected
information so you can verify everything.

The **SKILLS** step suggests additional hard and soft skills via OpenAI and
presents them as selectable buttons. Chosen suggestions are stored in your
profile. Skills are grouped into language skills, key competencies and other
requirements for a cleaner layout. The interactive salary chart now lives in the
final **SUMMARY** step and shows how different factors influence the expected
annual salary.

The **BENEFITS** step generates benefit suggestions based on the job title, the
company location and typical competitor offerings. Each suggestion appears as a
button that you can toggle to add it to your benefit list. For some cities the
app proposes local perks such as club memberships or discounted facilities
(e.g. "Fortuna D√ºsseldorf" membership). Regional perks now also exist for
Berlin, M√ºnchen, Hamburg and Frankfurt.

The **ROLE & TASKS** step now features a *Generate Role Description* button
that drafts a short description using similar job ads. In the **INTERVIEW**
step you can also request suggested recruitment steps and sample interview
questions.
You can now generate task suggestions via OpenAI or the ESCO API. Each
suggested task appears as a pill button and selections are stored under
"selected_tasks".

The task section lives in its own container. On‚Äëcall schedules stay hidden
until you tick the *On Call* box and travel details only appear once
travel is required. AI task generation lets you choose the number of
suggestions and optionally focus on a specific technology.

The **COMPANY & DEPARTMENT** step groups company info in a cleaner layout. The
*Team & Culture Context* now shows three bordered boxes. Each field provides a
**Generate Ideas** button above the input and AI suggestions appear as pill
buttons. The section is expanded by default and once all fields are filled a
short ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù toast pops up. Missing data remains highlighted in two
columns below the extracted values. After uploading a file a small success
message with a üî• icon confirms
that the extraction finished. Entering a job ad URL now triggers extraction
automatically and the welcome page shows how many fields were filled in
percentage.
Until you provide data the sidebar displays a short note telling you where
all collected information will appear.

Regex patterns for key information have been tightened and now support German
and English labels. Extracted values are validated by an LLM to increase
accuracy. Labels may now be prefixed with dashes or bullet characters.
If the patterns fail, a lightweight spaCy NER model guesses the company name
and city from the text.
LLM outputs are checked for missing fields and invalid JSON. If issues are detected the
assistant automatically re-prompts the model with clarification to improve the extraction.

## Wizard Steps

The wizard collects data in the following order:

1. BASIC
2. COMPANY & DEPARTMENT ‚Äì company and team details
3. ROLE & TASKS ‚Äì responsibilities and key tasks
4. SKILLS
5. BENEFITS
6. INTERVIEW ‚Äì contact roles are grouped by Line Manager, HR and Finance. Application details and onboarding options are arranged side by side.
7. SUMMARY ‚Äì includes Ideal Candidate Profile and Target Industries fields

In the final **SUMMARY** step you can generate a job advertisement, an interview
guide, a Boolean search string and a draft contract. New buttons also let you
estimate the salary range and calculate the total annual compensation based on
selected benefits.

## ESCO Integration

The tool includes helpers to query the [ESCO REST API](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/api) for
standardised occupations and skills. Environment variable `ESCO_API_BASE_URL` controls the
target endpoint. Occupation lookup and ESCO skill suggestions are available directly in the **SKILLS** step.

The helper uses the ``hasEssentialSkill`` relation to fetch essential skills for
an occupation from the ESCO API.

## Vector Search

Missing fields can be filled via Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Relevant job ads
and CV snippets are retrieved from the pre-trained "vacalyser" vector store and
passed to the LLM. Set ``VACALYSER_VECTOR_STORE`` to override the default store
ID.

## Wizard RL Helpers

The module ``wizard_rl.py`` contains utilities to load wizard schemas,
convert the current session state into feature vectors and persist simple
navigation policies. A minimal ``VacalyserWizardEnv`` environment is also
available to experiment with reinforcement learning approaches for skipping
irrelevant steps.
